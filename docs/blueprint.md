# **App Name**: Myth Weaver

## Core Features:

- Create Your Myth: Generate a unique image based on a detailed text description. The user can select a mythological culture, specify the entity or theme, add descriptive details, and choose a visual style, aspect ratio and image quality.
- Analyze Your Image: Upload an image and receive an AI analysis of its style and possible mythological connections. The user can provide a mythological context and entity/theme to guide the analysis tool.
- Reimagine Your Image: Upload an image and have the AI generate a new version with a different style or parameters.  The user can specify a mythological context, a new visual style, aspect ratio, and quality for the reimagined image. The LLM acts as a tool, to generate the reimaging prompt based on your context image, your image context, and your parameters.
- Creation Gallery: A personal, locally-stored and organized space for all creations, analyses, and reimaginings. The user can view all their works in visual cards with key information, search, sort, view details, edit names, resize images, copy prompts/analyses, and delete creations.
- Data Management: Export the entire gallery (metadata and images) to a JSON file for backup or migration. Import a previously exported gallery, merging or replacing the current one. Delete the entire gallery securely.
- Intuitive UI: Easy access to all main functions via a sidebar, a modern design using ShadCN UI components for a professional and consistent appearance, support for light and dark themes, notifications for important actions, and adaptability to different screen sizes.
